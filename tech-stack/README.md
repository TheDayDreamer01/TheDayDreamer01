# Tech Stack

**Hey there!** As an aspiring full stack developer, I've got my hands on some seriously cool tech stacks that have shaped me into who I am today. Let me give you the lowdown on my work tech stack, and the fun one I play around with.

In my work realm, I rock the `MERN` (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack like a boss! It's a powerful combination that allows me to build robust web applications from front to back. And hey, I'm not just limited to the JavaScript world. I also dive into the `Python Django framework`, creating some awesome web apps with its simplicity and elegance. And let's not forget about `ASP.NET` - a reliable and scalable stack that has helped me craft some top-notch applications.

But you know what they say, all work and no play makes for a dull developer. So, for fun and experimentation, I've got a sweet `Flutter-Flask` combo going on. Flutter's cross-platform magic combined with Flask's lightweight and flexible nature creates the perfect playground for me to create innovative and quirky projects.

## [MERN Stack](/tech-stack/node/README.md) 

`MERN` is pretty much like MEAN, with one main difference: instead of Angular.js, you swap it out with React.

The beauty of `MERN` lies in its seamless integration with React, enabling you to leverage code for both browsers and servers at the same time. With its robust library and full-stack development capabilities for both frontend and backend, `MERN` offers some serious perks.

And let's not forget about React itself, known for its flexibility and top-notch performance when it comes to crafting dynamic and interactive user interfaces. `MERN` truly packs a punch when it comes to building modern, feature-rich applications.
